In Chapter 5 we mentioned the four kinds of fundamental forces. To this point the only
one of these forces that we have examined in any detail is gravity. Now we are ready
to examine the force of electromagnetism, which encompasses both electricity and
magnetism.

Electromagnetic interactions involve particles that have electric charge, an attribute
that is as fundamental as mass. Just as objects with mass are accelerated by gravitational
forces, so electrically charged objects are accelerated by electric forces. The shock you
feel when you scuff your shoes across a carpet and then reach for a metal doorknob is due
to charged particles leaping between your finger and the doorknob. Electric currents are
simply streams of charged particles flowing within wires in response to electric forces.
Even the forces that hold atoms together to form solid matter, and that keep the atoms of
solid objects from passing through each other, are fundamentally due to electric interactions between the charged particles within atoms.
We begin our study of electromagnetism in this chapter by examining the nature of
electric charge. We'll find that charge is quantized and obeys a conservation principle.
When charges are at rest in our frame of reference, they exert electrostatic forces on each
other. These forces are of tremendous importance in chemistry and biology and have
many technological applications. Electrostatic forces are governed by a simple relationship known as Coulomb's law and are most conveniently described by using the concept
of electric field. In later chapters we'll expand our discussion to include electric charges
in motion. This will lead us to an understanding of magnetism and, remarkably, of the
nature of light.
While the key ideas of electromagnetism are conceptually simple, applying them to
practical problems will make use of many of your mathematical skills, especially your
knowledge of geometry and integral calculus. For this reason you may find this chapter
and those that follow to be more mathematically demanding than earlier chapters. The reward for your extra effort will be a deeper understanding of principles that are at the heart
of modern physics and technology.

1 ELECTRIC CHARGE.
The ancient Greeks discovered as early as 600 b.c. that after they rubbed amber with
wool, the amber could attract other objects. Today we say that the amber has acquired
a net electric charge, or has become charged. The word “electric” is derived from the
Greek word elektron, meaning amber. When you scuff your shoes across a nylon carpet,
you become electrically charged, and you can charge a comb by passing it through dry
hair.
Plastic rods and fur (real or fake) are particularly good for demonstrating electrostatics,
the interactions between electric charges that are at rest (or nearly so). After we charge
both plastic rods in Fig. 1a by rubbing them with the piece of fur, we find that the rods
repel each other.
When we rub glass rods with silk, the glass rods also become charged and repel each
other. But a charged plastic rod attracts a charged glass rod; furthermore, the
plastic rod and the fur attract each other, and the glass rod and the silk attract each other.
These experiments and many others like them have shown that there are exactly two
kinds of electric charge: the kind on the plastic rod rubbed with fur and the kind on the
glass rod rubbed with silk. Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) suggested calling these two
kinds of charge negative and positive, respectively, and these names are still used. The
plastic rod and the silk have negative charge; the glass rod and the fur have positive charge.

Two positive charges or two negative charges repel each other. A positive charge
and a negative charge attract each other.
 CAUTION Electric attraction and repulsion The attraction and repulsion of two charged objects
are sometimes summarized as “Like charges repel, and opposite charges attract.” But “like charges”
does not mean that the two charges are exactly identical, only that both charges have the same
algebraic sign (both positive or both negative). “Opposite charges” means that both objects have an
electric charge, and those charges have different signs (one positive and the other negative).

A laser printer utilizes the forces between charged objects. The printer's
light-sensitive imaging drum is given a positive charge. As the drum rotates, a laser
beam shines on selected areas of the drum, leaving those areas with a negative charge.
Positively charged particles of toner adhere only to the areas of the drum “written” by the
laser. When a piece of paper is placed in contact with the drum, the toner particles stick to
the paper and form an image.
Electric Charge and the Structure of Matter
When you charge a rod by rubbing it with fur or silk as in Fig. 1, there is no visible
change in the appearance of the rod. What, then, actually happens to the rod when you
charge it? To answer this question, we must look more closely at the structure of atoms,
the building blocks of ordinary matter.
The structure of atoms can be described in terms of three particles: the negatively
charged electron, the positively charged proton, and the uncharged neutron.
The proton and neutron are combinations of other entities called quarks, which have
charges of {1
3 and {2
3 times the electron charge. Isolated quarks have not been observed,
and there are theoretical reasons to believe that it is impossible in principle to observe a
quark in isolation.
The protons and neutrons in an atom make up a small, very dense core called the
nucleus, with dimensions of the order of 10-15 m. Surrounding the nucleus are the electrons, extending out to distances of the order of 10-10 m from the nucleus. If an atom
were a few kilometers across, its nucleus would be the size of a tennis ball. The negatively
charged electrons are held within the atom by the attractive electric forces exerted on
them by the positively charged nucleus. (The protons and neutrons are held within stable
atomic nuclei by an attractive interaction, called the strong nuclear force, that overcomes
the electric repulsion of the protons. The strong nuclear force has a short range, and its
effects do not extend far beyond the nucleus.)

The masses of the individual particles, to the precision that they are known (as of
	this writing), are
	 Mass of electron = me = 9.11 * 10-31 kg
	 Mass of proton = mp = 1.67 * 10-27 kg
	 Mass of neutron = mn = 1.68 * 10-27 kg
	The numbers in parentheses are the uncertainties in the last two digits. Note that the
	masses of the proton and neutron are nearly equal and are roughly 2000 times the mass
	of the electron. Over 99.9% of the mass of any atom is concentrated in its nucleus.


	The negative charge of the electron has (within experimental error) exactly the same
	magnitude as the positive charge of the proton. In a neutral atom the number of electrons
	equals the number of protons in the nucleus, and the net electric charge (the algebraic
	sum of all the charges) is exactly zero. The number of protons or electrons in
	a neutral atom of an element is called the atomic number of the element. If one or more
	electrons are removed from an atom, what remains is called a positive ion. A
	negative ion is an atom that has gained one or more electrons. This gain or
	loss of electrons is called ionization.
	When the total number of protons in a macroscopic object equals the total number of
	electrons, the total charge is zero and the object as a whole is electrically neutral. To give
	an object an excess negative charge, we may either add negative charges to a neutral object or remove positive charges from that object. Similarly, we can create an excess positive charge by either adding positive charge or removing negative charge. In most cases,
	negatively charged (and highly mobile) electrons are added or removed, and a “positively
	charged object” is one that has lost some of its normal complement of electrons. When we
	speak of the charge of an object, we always mean its net charge. The net charge is always
	a very small fraction (typically no more than 10-12) of the total positive charge or negative
	charge in the object.
	Electric Charge Is Conserved
	Implicit in the foregoing discussion are two very important principles, the first of which is:

	PRINCIPLE OF CONSERVATION OF CHARGE The algebraic sum of all the
	electric charges in any closed system is constant.
   If we rub together a plastic rod and a piece of fur, both initially uncharged, the rod acquires a negative charge (since it takes electrons from the fur) and the fur acquires a positive charge of the same magnitude (since it has lost as many electrons as the rod has
   gained). Hence the total electric charge on the two objects together does not change. In
   any charging process, charge is not created or destroyed; it is merely transferred from one
   object to another.
   Conservation of charge is thought to be a universal conservation law. No
   experimental evidence for any violation of this principle has ever been observed.
   Even in high-energy interactions in which particles are created and destroyed, such
   as the creation of electron-positron pairs, the total charge of any closed system is
   exactly constant.

   The second important principle is: The magnitude of charge of the electron or proton is a natural unit of charge.

   Every observable amount of electric charge is always an integer multiple of this basic
   unit. We say that charge is quantized. A familiar example of quantization is money. When
   you pay cash for an item in a store, you have to do it in one-cent increments. Cash can't
   be divided into amounts smaller than one cent, and electric charge can't be divided into
   amounts smaller than the charge of one electron or proton. (The quark charges, {1
   3 and
   {2
   3 of the electron charge, are probably not observable as isolated charges.) Thus the
   charge on any macroscopic object is always zero or an integer multiple (negative or positive) of the electron charge.
   Understanding the electric nature of matter gives us insight into many aspects of the
   physical world. The chemical bonds that hold atoms together to form molecules are due to electric interactions between the atoms. They include the strong ionic
   bonds that hold sodium and chlorine atoms together to make table salt and the relatively
   weak bonds between the strands of DNA that record your body's genetic code. When you
   stand, the normal force exerted on you by the floor arises from electric forces between
   charged particles in the atoms of your shoes and the atoms of the floor. The tension force
   in a stretched string and the adhesive force of glue are likewise due to electric interactions
   of atoms.

   TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF SECTION 1 Two charged objects repel each other
   through the electric force. The charges on the objects are 1. one positive and one negative; 2. both
   positive; 3. both negative; 4. either 2. or 3.; 5. any of 1, 2 or 3.

   2 CONDUCTORS, INSULATORS, AND INDUCED CHARGES
  Some materials permit electric charge to move easily from one region of the material to
  another, while others do not. For example, Fig. 6a shows a copper wire supported by
  a nylon thread. Suppose you touch one end of the wire to a charged plastic rod and attach
  the other end to a metal ball that is initially uncharged; you then remove the charged rod
  and the wire. When you bring another charged object up close to the ball, the ball is attracted or repelled, showing that the ball has become electrically
  charged. Electric charge has been transferred through the copper wire between the ball
  and the surface of the plastic rod.
  The copper wire is called a conductor of electricity. If you repeat the experiment
  using a rubber band or nylon thread in place of the wire, you find that no charge is
  transferred to the ball. These materials are called insulators. Conductors permit the
  easy movement of charge through them, while insulators do not. (The supporting nylon
  threads shown in Fig. 6 are insulators, which prevents charge from leaving the metal
  ball and copper wire.)
  As an example, carpet fibers on a dry day are good insulators. As you walk across a
  carpet, the rubbing of your shoes against the fibers causes charge to build up on you, and
  this charge remains on you because it can't flow through the insulating fibers. If you then
  touch a conducting object such as a doorknob, a rapid charge transfer takes place between
  your finger and the doorknob, and you feel a shock. One way to prevent this is to wind
  some of the carpet fibers around conducting cores so that any charge that builds up on you
  can be transferred harmlessly to the carpet. Another solution is to coat the carpet fibers
  with an antistatic layer that does not easily transfer electrons to or from your shoes; this
  prevents any charge from building up on you in the first place.

  Most metals are good conductors, while most nonmetals are insulators. Within a
  solid metal such as copper, one or more outer electrons in each atom become detached
  and can move freely throughout the material, just as the molecules of a gas can move
  through the spaces between the grains in a bucket of sand. The other electrons remain
  bound to the positively charged nuclei, which themselves are bound in nearly fixed
  positions within the material. In an insulator there are no, or very few, free electrons,
  and electric charge cannot move freely through the material. Some materials called
  semiconductors are intermediate in their properties between good conductors and good
  insulators.

  Charging by Induction
  We can charge a metal ball by using a copper wire and an electrically charged plastic
  rod, as in Fig. 6a. In this process, some of the excess electrons on the rod are transferred from it to the ball, leaving the rod with a smaller negative charge. But there
  is a different technique in which the plastic rod can give another object a charge of
  opposite sign without losing any of its own charge. This process is called charging
  by induction.
  Figure 7 shows an example of charging by induction. An uncharged metal ball is
  supported on an insulating stand. When you bring a negatively charged rod
  near it, without actually touching it, the free electrons in the metal ball are
  repelled by the excess electrons on the rod, and they shift toward the right, away from the
  rod. They cannot escape from the ball because the supporting stand and the surrounding
  air are insulators. So we get excess negative charge at the right surface of the ball and a
  deficiency of negative charge (that is, a net positive charge) at the left surface. These excess charges are called induced charges.
  Not all of the free electrons move to the right surface of the ball. As soon as any induced charge develops, it exerts forces toward the left on the other free electrons. These
  electrons are repelled by the negative induced charge on the right and attracted toward
  the positive induced charge on the left. The system reaches an equilibrium state in which
  the force toward the right on an electron, due to the charged rod, is just balanced by the
  force toward the left due to the induced charge. If we remove the charged rod, the free
  electrons shift back to the left, and the original neutral condition is restored.
  What happens if, while the plastic rod is nearby, you touch one end of a conducting
  wire to the right surface of the ball and the other end to the earth? The earth
  is a conductor, and it is so large that it can act as a practically infinite source of extra electrons or sink of unwanted electrons. Some of the negative charge flows through the wire
  to the earth. Now suppose you disconnect the wire and then remove the rod; a net positive charge is left on the ball. The charge on the negatively charged
  rod has not changed during this process. The earth acquires a negative charge that is
  equal in magnitude to the induced positive charge remaining on the ball.

  Electric Forces on Uncharged Objects
  Finally, we note that a charged object can exert forces even on objects that are not charged
  themselves. If you rub a balloon on the rug and then hold the balloon against the ceiling,
  it sticks, even though the ceiling has no net electric charge. After you electrify a comb by
  running it through your hair, you can pick up uncharged bits of paper or plastic with it. How is this possible?
  This interaction is an induced-charge effect. Even in an insulator, electric
  charges can shift back and forth a little when there is charge nearby. This is shown
  in Fig. 8b; the negatively charged plastic comb causes a slight shifting of charge
  within the molecules of the neutral insulator, an effect called polarization. The positive and negative charges in the material are present in equal amounts, but the positive
  charges are closer to the plastic comb and so feel an attraction that is stronger than the
  repulsion felt by the negative charges, giving a net attractive force. (In Section 3
  we'll study how electric forces depend on distance.) Note that a neutral insulator is
  also attracted to a positively charged comb. Now the charges in the insulator shift in the opposite direction; the negative charges in the insulator are closer to
  the comb and feel an attractive force that is stronger than the repulsion felt by the
  positive charges in the insulator. Hence a charged object of either sign exerts an attractive force on an uncharged insulator. Figure 9 shows an industrial application
  of this effect.

  TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF SECTION 2 You have two lightweight metal spheres,
  each hanging from an insulating nylon thread. One of the spheres has a net negative charge, while
  the other sphere has no net charge. (a) If the spheres are close together but do not touch, will they
  (i) attract each other, (ii) repel each other, or (iii) exert no force on each other? (b) You now allow
  the two spheres to touch. Once they have touched, will the two spheres (i) attract each other,
  (ii) repel each other, or (iii) exert no force on each other?

  3 COULOMB'S LAW
Charles Augustin de Coulomb (1736-1806) studied the interaction forces of charged particles in detail in 1784. He used a torsion balance similar to the one used
13 years later by Cavendish to study the much weaker gravitational interaction, as we discussed in Section 13.1. For point charges, charged objects that are very small in comparison with the distance r between them, Coulomb found that the electric force is proportional
to 1>r2
. That is, when the distance r doubles, the force decreases to one-quarter of its initial value; when the distance is halved, the force increases to four times its initial value.
The electric force between two point charges also depends on the quantity of charge on
each object, which we'll denote by q or Q. To explore this dependence, Coulomb divided
a charge into two equal parts by placing a small charged spherical conductor into contact
with an identical but uncharged sphere; by symmetry, the charge is shared equally between
the two spheres. (Note the essential role of the principle of conservation of charge in this
procedure.) Thus he could obtain one-half, one-quarter, and so on, of any initial charge. He
found that the forces that two point charges q1 and q2 exert on each other are proportional
to each charge and therefore are proportional to the product q1q2 of the two charges.
Thus Coulomb established the following law:

COULOMB'S LAW The magnitude of the electric force between two point
charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely
 proportional to the square of the distance between them
 In mathematical terms, the magnitude F of the force that each of two point charges q1 and
 q2 a distance r apart exerts on the other can be expressed as omitted
 where k is a proportionality constant whose numerical value depends on the system of
 units used. The absolute value bars are used in Eq. (1) because the charges q1 and q2
 can be either positive or negative, while the force magnitude F is always positive.
 The directions of the forces the two charges exert on each other are always along the
 line joining them. When the charges q1 and q2 have the same sign, either both positive or
 both negative, the forces are repulsive; when the charges have opposite signs, the forces
 are attractive. The two forces obey Newton's third law; they are always equal
 in magnitude and opposite in direction, even when the charges are not equal in magnitude.


 The proportionality of the electric force to 1>r2
 has been verified with great precision. There is no reason to suspect that the exponent is different from precisely 2. Thus
the form of Eq. (1) is the same as that of the law of gravitation. But electric and
 gravitational interactions are two distinct classes of phenomena. Electric interactions depend on electric charges and can be either attractive or repulsive, while gravitational
interactions depend on mass and are always attractive (because there is no such thing as
negative mass).


Fundamental Electric Constants
The value of the proportionality constant k in Coulomb's law depends on the system of
units used. In our study of electricity and magnetism we'll use SI units exclusively. The
SI electric units include most of the familiar units such as the volt, the ampere, the ohm,
and the watt. (There is no British system of electric units.) The SI unit of electric charge is
called one coulomb (1 C). As of this writing (2018) the value of the constant k in Eq. (1)
is, to nine significant figures,
k = 8.99 * 10^9
 N # m2>C2 ≅ 8.988 * 10^9
 N # m2>C2
Prior to 2018 k was defined to have a precise value in terms of the speed of light in vacuum c, whose value is in turn related to the definitions of the second and the meter that
we stated in Section 1.3. (We'll see the connection between k and c in Chapter 32 when
we study electromagnetic radiation.) With the revisions to the definitions of units in the
International System (SI) in 2018, the value of k is no longer exact, but has a very small
fractional uncertainty of about 2 * 10-10. Because this uncertainty is so small, these revisions to the definitions of the units have no effect on the calculations that we present in
this book, and don't affect the calculations that you'll do.
In principle we can measure the electric force F between two equal charges q at a measured distance r and use Coulomb's law to determine the charge. Thus we could regard
the value of k as an operational definition of the coulomb. For reasons of experimental
precision it is better to define the coulomb instead in terms of the most fundamental unit
of charge. This is the magnitude of the charge of an electron or a proton, which is denoted
by e. The value of e is defined to be a certain fraction of a coulomb:
e = 1.6 * 10-19 C
So one coulomb (C) is that amount of charge such that 1.6 : 10-19 C
is equal to the magnitude of the charge on an electron or proton. (An older definition
of the coulomb involving the unit of electric current, or charge per unit time, was abandoned in 2018.)
One coulomb represents the negative of the total charge of about 6 * 108 electrons.
For comparison, a copper cube 1 cm on a side contains about 2.4 * 1024 electrons. About
1019 electrons pass through the glowing filament of a flashlight bulb every second.
In SI units we usually write the constant k in Eq. (1) as 1>4pP0, where P0 (“epsilonnought” or “epsilon-zero”) is called the electric constant. This shorthand simplifies
many formulas that we'll encounter in later chapters. From now on, we'll usually write
Coulomb's law as omitted

In electrostatics problems (problems that involve charges at rest), it's very unusual to
encounter charges as large as 1 coulomb. Two 1 C charges separated by 1 m would exert
forces on each other of magnitude 9 * 109
 N! The total charge of all the electrons in a
copper one-cent coin is even greater, about 1.4 * 105
 C, which shows that we can't disturb electric neutrality very much without using enormous forces. More typical values
of charge range from about a microcoulomb 11 mC = 10-6
 C2 to about a nanocoulomb
11 nC = 10-9
 C2.


 Superposition of Forces
Coulomb's law as we have stated it describes only the interaction of two point charges.
Experiments show that when two charges exert forces simultaneously on a third charge,
the total force acting on that charge is the vector sum of the forces that the two charges
would exert individually. This important property, called the principle of superposition
of forces, holds for any number of charges. By using this principle, we can apply
Coulomb's law to any collection of charges. Two of the examples at the end of this section
use the superposition principle.
Strictly speaking, Coulomb's law as we have stated it should be used only for point
charges in a vacuum. If matter is present in the space between the charges, the net force
acting on each charge is altered because charges are induced in the molecules of the intervening material. We'll describe this effect later. As a practical matter, though, we can
use Coulomb's law unaltered for point charges in air. At normal atmospheric pressure,
the presence of air changes the electric force from its vacuum value by only about one
part in 2000.

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY 1 Coulomb's Law
IDENTIFY the relevant concepts: Coulomb's law describes the electric force between charged particles.
SET UP the problem using the following steps:
1. Sketch the locations of the charged particles and label each particle with its charge.
2. If the charges do not all lie on a single line, set up an
xy- coordinate system.
3. The problem will ask you to find the electric force on one or more
particles. Identify which these are.
EXECUTE the solution as follows:
1. For each particle that exerts an electric force on a given particle
of interest, use Eq. (2) to calculate the magnitude of that force.
2. Using those magnitudes, sketch a free-body diagram showing the
electric-force vectors acting on each particle of interest. The force
exerted by particle 1 on particle 2 points from particle 2 toward particle 1 if the charges have opposite signs, but points from particle
2 directly away from particle 1 if the charges have the same sign.
3. Use the principle of superposition to calculate the total electric
force—a vector sum—on each particle of interest. (Review the
vector algebra in Sections 1.7 through 1.9. The method of components is often helpful.)
4. Use consistent units; SI units are completely consistent. With
1 all over 4 pi epsilon 0 = 9.0 * 10 to power 9
 Newton dot meter squared over Coulomb squared
, distances must be in meters,
charges in coulombs, and forces in newtons.
5. Some examples and problems in this and later chapters involve
continuous distributions of charge along a line, over a surface,
or throughout a volume. In these cases the vector sum in step 3
becomes a vector integral. We divide the charge distribution into
infinitesimal pieces, use Coulomb's law for each piece, and integrate to find the vector sum. Sometimes this can be done without
actual integration.
6. Exploit any symmetries in the charge distribution to simplify your
problem solving. For example, two identical charges q exert zero
net electric force on a charge Q midway between them, because the
forces on Q have equal magnitude and opposite direction.
EVALUATE your answer: Check whether your numerical results are
reasonable. Confirm that the direction of the net electric force agrees
with the principle that charges of the same sign repel and charges of
opposite sign attract.

TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF SECTION 3 Suppose that charge q2 in Example 4
were -2.0 mC. In this case, the total electric force on Q would be 1. in the positive x-direction; 2.
in the negative x-direction; 3. in the positive y-direction; 4. in the negative y-direction; 5. zero;
6. none of these.

4 ELECTRIC FIELD AND ELECTRIC FORCES
When two electrically charged particles in empty space interact, how does each one know
the other is there? We can begin to answer this question, and at the same time reformulate
Coulomb's law in a very useful way, by using the concept of electric field.

BIO APPLICATION Sharks and the
“Sixth Sense” Sharks have the ability to
locate prey (such as flounder and other
bottom-dwelling fish) that are completely
hidden beneath the sand at the bottom
of the ocean. They do this by sensing the
weak electric fields produced by muscle
contractions in their prey. Sharks derive
their sensitivity to electric fields (a “sixth
sense”) from jelly-filled canals in their
bodies. These canals end in pores on the
shark's skin (shown in this photograph).
An electric field as weak as 5 * 10e-7 N/C
causes charge flow within the canals and
triggers a signal in the shark's nervous
system. Because the shark has canals
with different orientations, it can measure
different components of the electric-field
vector and hence determine the direction
of the field.

Electric Field
To introduce this concept, let's look at the mutual repulsion of two positively charged objects A and B. Suppose B has charge q0, and let F0 be the electric force of A
on B. One way to think about this force is as an “action-at-a-distance” force—that is, as a
force that acts across empty space without needing physical contact between A and B.
(Gravity can also be thought of as an “action-at-a-distance” force.) But a more fruitful
way to visualize the repulsion between A and B is as a two-stage process. We first envision that object A, as a result of the charge that it carries, somehow modifies the properties
of the space around it. Then object B, as a result of the charge that it carries, senses how
space has been modified at its position. The response of object B is to experience the force F0.
To clarify how this two-stage process occurs, we first consider object A by itself: We
remove object B and label its former position as point P. We say that the
charged object A produces or causes an electric field at point P (and at all other points in
the neighborhood). This electric field is present at P even if there is no charge at P; it is a
consequence of the charge on object A only. If a point charge q0 is then placed at point P, it
experiences the force F0. We take the point of view that this force is exerted on q0 by the
field at P. Thus the electric field is the intermediary through which A communicates its presence to q0. Because the point charge q0 would experience a force at any
point in the neighborhood of A, the electric field that A produces exists at all points in the
region around A.
We can likewise say that the point charge q0 produces an electric field in the space
around it and that this electric field exerts the force minus F0 on object A. For each force
(the force of A on q0 and the force of q0 on A), one charge sets up an electric field that
exerts a force on the second charge. We emphasize that this is an interaction between two
charged objects. A single charge produces an electric field in the surrounding space, but
this electric field cannot exert a net force on the charge that created it; as we discussed in
Section 4.3, an object cannot exert a net force on itself. (If this wasn't true, you would be
able to lift yourself to the ceiling by pulling up on your belt!)

The electric force on a charged object is exerted by the electric field created by
other charged objects.

To find out experimentally whether there is an electric field at a particular point, we
place a small charged object, which we call a test charge, at the point. If the
test charge experiences an electric force, then there is an electric field at that point. This
field is produced by charges other than q0.
Force is a vector quantity, so electric field is also a vector quantity. (Note the use
of vector signs as well as boldface letters and plus, minus, and equals signs in the following discussion.) We define the electric field E at a point as the electric force F0

experienced by a test charge q0 at the point, divided by the charge q0. That is, the electric field at a certain point is equal to the electric force per unit charge experienced by
a charge at that point:

In SI units, in which the unit of force is 1 N and the unit of charge is 1 C, the unit of
electric-field magnitude is 1 newton per coulomb.
If the field E
 at a certain point is known, rearranging Eq. 3 gives the force F0
experienced by a point charge q0 placed at that point. This force is just equal to the electric
field E
 produced at that point by charges other than q0, multiplied by the charge q0:
 F0 = q0 * E force exerted on a point charge q0
 by an electric field E

The charge q0 can be either positive or negative. If q0 is positive, the force F0 experienced by the charge is in the same direction as E; if q0 is negative, F0 and E are in opposite directions.
While the electric field concept may be new to you, the basic idea—that one object sets
up a field in the space around it and a second object responds to that field—is one that
you've actually used before. Compare Eq. 4 to the familiar expression for the gravitational force Fg that the earth exerts on a mass m0: Fg = m0g

In this expression, g is the acceleration due to gravity. If we divide both sides of Eq. 5 by the mass m0, we obtain g = Fg over m0

Thus g can be regarded as the gravitational force per unit mass. By analogy to Eq. (3),
we can interpret g as the gravitational field. Thus we treat the gravitational interaction between the earth and the mass m0 as a two-stage process: The earth sets up a gravitational
field g in the space around it, and this gravitational field exerts a force given by Eq. 5
on the mass m0 (which we can regard as a test mass). The gravitational field g
, or gravitational force per unit mass, is a useful concept because it does not depend on the mass
of the object on which the gravitational force is exerted; likewise, the electric field E,
or electric force per unit charge, is useful because it does not depend on the charge of the
object on which the electric force is exerted.

CAUTION F0 = q0E is for point test charges only The electric force experienced by a test
charge q0 can vary from point to point, so the electric field can also be different at different
points. For this reason, use Eq. 4 to find the electric force on a point charge only. If a
charged object is large enough in size, the electric field E may be noticeably different in magnitude and direction at different points on the object, and calculating the net electric force on it can be complicated.

Electric Field of a Point Charge
If the source distribution is a point charge q, it is easy to find the electric field
that it produces. We call the location of the charge the source point, and we call
the point P where we are determining the field the field point. It is also useful to introduce a unit vector nr that points along the line from source point to field
point (Fig. 17a, next page). This unit vector is equal to the displacement vector r from
the source point to the field point, divided by the distance r = abs vector r between these two points; that is, r tilde = vector r over r. If we place a small test charge q0 at the field point P, at a distance r
from the source point, the magnitude F0 of the force is given by Coulomb's law.

From Eq. 3 the magnitude E of the electric field at P is E = 1 over 4 pi espsion zero multiplied by abs q over r squared. That is eq. 6 magnitude of electric field due to a point charge.

Using the unit vector nr, we can write a vector equation that gives both the magnitude and
direction of the electric field E

CAUTION The electric field at a point does not depend on the charge at that point Equation 7 tells you the value of the electric field E
at a certain point due to a point charge q at a different point. The electric field at a certain point is present whether or not there is a second point
charge at that point to experience the field. 
We have emphasized calculating the electric field E
 at a certain point. But since E
 can
vary from point to point, it is not a single vector quantity but rather an infinite set of vector
quantities, one associated with each point in space. This is an example of a vector field.
Figure 18 shows a number of the field vectors produced by a positive or negative point
charge. If we use a rectangular 1x, y, z2 coordinate system, each component of E
 at any
point is in general a function of the coordinates 1x, y, z2 of the point. We can represent
the functions as Ex1x, y, z2, Ey1x, y, z2, and Ez1x, y, z2. Another example of a vector field
is the velocity Y
 of wind currents; the magnitude and direction of Y
, and hence its vector
components, vary from point to point in the atmosphere.
In some situations the magnitude and direction of the field (and hence its vector components) have the same values everywhere throughout a certain region; we then say that the
field is uniform in this region. An important example of this is the electric field inside a
conductor. If there is an electric field within a conductor, the field exerts a force on every
charge in the conductor, giving the free charges a net motion. By definition an electrostatic
situation is one in which the charges have no net motion. We conclude that in electrostatics
the electric field at every point within the material of a conductor must be zero. (Note that
we are not saying that the field is necessarily zero in a hole inside a conductor.)
In summary, our description of electric interactions has two parts. First, a given charge
distribution acts as a source of electric field. Second, the electric field exerts a force on any charge that is present in the field. Our analysis often has two corresponding steps: first, calculating the field caused by a source charge distribution; second, looking at the effect of
the field in terms of force and motion. The second step often involves Newton's laws as well
as the principles of electric interactions. In the next section we show how to calculate fields
caused by various source distributions, but first here are three examples of calculating the
field due to a point charge and of finding the force on a charge due to a given field E.

KEYCONCEPT The magnitude of the electric field that a point
charge produces at a given point is (a) proportional to the magnitude of
the charge and (b) inversely proportional to the square of the distance
from the point charge to the point where the field is measured.

KEYCONCEPT When you calculate the electric field due to a point
charge q, the unit vector nr always points from the charge to the point
where the field is measured. If q is positive, the field is in the same
direction as nr (away from the charge); if q is negative, the field is in the
direction opposite to nr (toward the charge.)

TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF SECTION 4 (a) A negative point charge moves along
a straight-line path directly toward a stationary positive point charge. Which aspect(s) of the electric
force on the negative point charge will remain constant as it moves? 1 Magnitude; 2 direction;
3 both magnitude and direction; 4 neither magnitude nor direction. (b) A negative point charge
moves along a circular orbit around a positive point charge. Which aspect(s) of the electric force on
the negative point charge will remain constant as it moves? 1 Magnitude; 2 direction; 3 both
magnitude and direction; 4 neither magnitude nor direction.

5 ELECTRIC-FIELD CALCULATIONS
Equation 7 gives the electric field caused by a single point charge. But in most realistic situations that involve electric fields and forces, we encounter charge that is distributed
over space. The charged plastic and glass rods in Fig. 1 have electric charge distributed
over their surfaces, as does the imaging drum of a laser printer. In this section
we'll learn to calculate electric fields caused by various distributions of electric charge.
Calculations of this kind are of tremendous importance for technological applications of
electric forces. To determine the trajectories of atomic nuclei in an accelerator for cancer radiotherapy or of charged particles in a semiconductor electronic device, you have to
know the detailed nature of the electric field acting on the charges.

The Superposition of Electric Fields
To find the field caused by a charge distribution, we imagine the distribution to be made
up of many point charges q1, q2, q3, c. (This is actually quite a realistic description,
since we have seen that charge is carried by electrons and protons that are so small as to
be almost pointlike.) At any given point P, each point charge produces its own electric
field E1, E2, E3, ..., so a test charge q0 placed at P experiences a force F1 = q0E1 from charge q1, a force F2 = q0E2 from charge q2, and so on. From the principle of superposition of forces discussed in Section 3, the total force F0 that the charge distribution exerts on q0 is the vector sum of these individual forces:

The combined effect of all the charges in the distribution is described by the total electric field E at point P. From the definition of electric field, Eq. 3, this is

E = F0 over q0 = E1 + E2 + E3 + ...

This equation is the mathematical expression of the principle of superposition of electric fields, illustrated in Fig. 21:

PRINCIPLE OF SUPERPOSITION OF ELECTRIC FIELDS The total electric field at a point P is the vector sum of the fields at P due to each point charge in the charge distribution.

When charge is distributed along a line, over a surface, or through a volume, a few additional terms are useful. For a line charge distribution (such as a long, thin, charged plastic rod), we use lambda to represent the linear charge density (charge perunit length, measured in C/m). When charge is distributed over a surface (such as the surface of the imaging drum of a laser printer), we use sigma to represent the surface charge density (charge per unit area, measured in C/m2). And when charge is distributed through a volume, we use rho to represent the volume charge density (charge per unit volume, C/m3).
Some of the calculations in the following examples may look complex. After you've
worked through the examples one step at a time, the process will seem less formidable.
We'll use many of the calculational techniques in these examples in Chapter 28 to calculate
the magnetic fields caused by charges in motion.

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY 2 Electric-Field Calculations

IDENTIFY the relevant concepts: Use the principle of superposition to calculate the electric field due to a discrete or continuous charge distribution.
SET UP the problem using the following steps:
1. Make a drawing showing the locations of the charges and your choice of coordinate axes.
2. On your drawing, indicate the position of the field point P (the point at which you want to calculate the electric field E).

EXECUTE the solution as follows:
1. Use consistent units. Distances must be in meters and charge
must be in coulombs. If you are given centimeters or nanocoulombs, don't forget to convert.
2. Distinguish between the source point S and the field point P. The
field produced by a point charge always points from S to P if the
charge is positive, and from P to S if the charge is negative.
3. Use vector addition when applying the principle of superposition;
review the treatment of vector addition in Chapter 1 if necessary.
4. Simplify your calculations by exploiting any symmetries in the
charge distribution.
5. If the charge distribution is continuous, define a small element of charge that can be considered as a point, find its electric field at P,
and find a way to add the fields of all the charge elements by doing
an integral. Usually it is easiest to do this for each component of E separately, so you may need to evaluate more than one integral.
Ensure that the limits on your integrals are correct; especially when
the situation has symmetry, don't count a charge twice.

EVALUATE your answer: Check that the direction of E is reasonable.
If your result for the electric-field magnitude E is a function of position (say, the coordinate x), check your result in any limits for which
you know what the magnitude should be. When possible, check your
answer by calculating it in a different way.

KEYCONCEPT To find the net electric field at a point due to two or more point charges, first find the field at that point due to each individual charge. Then use vector addition to find the magnitude and direction of the net field at that point.

KEYCONCEPT To find the vector components of the net electric
field at a point due to a continuous distribution of charge, first divide the
distribution into infinitesimally small segments. Then find the components of the field at the point due to one such segment. Finally, integrate
each component of the field due to a segment over all segments in the charge distribution.

KEYCONCEPT The electric field due to a symmetrical distribution of charge is most easily calculated at a point of symmetry. Whenever possible, take advantage of the symmetry of the situation to check your results.

KEYCONCEPT To find the electric field due to a two-dimensional
charge distribution such as a disk, divide the distribution into infinitesimal segments such as rings for which you know the components of the
electric field. Then integrate over these segments to find the net field.

KEYCONCEPT An infinite, uniform sheet of charge produces a uniform electric field at all points. If the charge is positive, the field points
away from the sheet; if the charge is negative, the field points toward
the sheet.

6 ELECTRIC FIELD LINES
The concept of an electric field can be a little elusive because you can't see an electric field directly. Electric field lines can be a big help for visualizing electric fields and making them seem more real. An electric field line is an imaginary line or curve drawn through a region of space so that its tangent at any point is in the direction of the electricfield vector at that point. Figure 27 shows the basic idea. (We used a similar concept in our discussion of fluid flow in Section 12.5. A streamline is a line or curve whose tangent at any point is in the direction of the velocity of the fluid at that point. However, the similarity between electric field lines and fluid streamlines is a mathematical one only; there is nothing “flowing” in an electric field.) The English scientist Michael Faraday (1791-1867) first introduced the concept of field lines. He called them “lines of force,”but the term “field lines” is preferable.

Electric field lines show the direction of E at each point, and their spacing gives a general idea of the magnitude of E at each point. Where E is strong, we draw lines close together; where E is weaker, they are farther apart. At any particular point, the electric field has a unique direction, so only one field line can pass through each point of the field. In other words, field lines never intersect.

Figure 28 shows some of the electric field lines in a plane containing (a) a single positive charge; (b) two equal-magnitude charges, one positive and one negative
(a dipole); and (c) two equal positive charges. Such diagrams are called field maps;
they are cross sections of the actual three-dimensional patterns. The direction of the
total electric field at every point in each diagram is along the tangent to the electric
field line passing through the point. Arrowheads indicate the direction of the E-field vector along each field line. The actual field vectors have been drawn at several points in each pattern. Notice that in general, the magnitude of the electric field is different at different points on a given field line; a field line is not a curve of constant electricfield magnitude!

Figure 28 shows that field lines are directed away from positive charges (since
close to a positive point charge, E points away from the charge) and toward negative charges (since close to a negative point charge, E points toward the charge).
In regions where the field magnitude is large, such as between the positive and negative charges in Fig. 28b, the field lines are drawn close together. 
In regions where the field magnitude is small, such as between the two positive charges in Fig. 28c, the lines are widely separated. 
In a uniform field, the field lines are straight, parallel, and uniformly spaced, as in Fig. 20

Figure 29a is a view from above of a demonstration setup for visualizing electric
field lines. In the arrangement shown here, the tips of two positively charged wires are
inserted in a container of insulating liquid, and some grass seeds are floated on the liquid.
The grass seeds are electrically neutral insulators, but the electric field of the two charged
wires causes polarization of the grass seeds; there is a slight shifting of the positive and
negative charges within the molecules of each seed, like that shown in Fig. 8. The
positively charged end of each grass seed is pulled in the direction of E  and the negatively
charged end is pulled opposite E. Hence the long axis of each grass seed tends to orient parallel to the electric field, in the direction of the field line that passes through the position of the seed.

CAUTION Electric field lines are not trajectories It's a common misconception that if a particle of charge q is in motion where there is an electric field, the particle must move along an electric field line. Because E at any point is tangent to the field line that passes through that point, it is true that the force F = qE on the particle, and hence the particle's acceleration, are tangent to the field line.
But we learned in Chapter 3 that when a particle moves on a curved path, its acceleration cannot be tangent to the path. In general, the trajectory of a charged particle is not the same as a field line.

TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF SECTION 6. Suppose the electric field lines in a region of space are straight lines. 
If a charged particle is released from rest in that region, will the trajectory of the particle be along a field line?

7 ELECTRIC DIPOLES
An electric dipole is a pair of point charges with equal magnitude and opposite sign (a positive charge q and a negative charge -q) separated by a distance d. 
We introduced electric dipoles in Example 8 (Section 5); the concept is worth exploring further because many physical systems, from molecules to TV antennas, can be described as electric dipoles. 
We'll also use this concept extensively in our discussion of dielectrics in Chapter 24.

Figure 30a shows a molecule of water, which in many ways behaves
like an electric dipole. The water molecule as a whole is electrically neutral, but the
chemical bonds within the molecule cause a displacement of charge; the result is a net
negative charge on the oxygen end of the molecule and a net positive charge on the hydrogen end, forming an electric dipole. The effect is equivalent to shifting one electron
only about 4 * 10e-11 m (about the radius of a hydrogen atom), but the consequences of
this shift are profound. Water is an excellent solvent for ionic substances such as table
salt precisely because the water molecule is an electric dipole. When dissolved in water, salt dissociates into a positive sodium ion Na plus

and a negative chlorine ion 1Cl-2, which tend to be attracted to the negative and positive
ends, respectively, of water molecules; this holds the ions in solution. If water molecules
were not electric dipoles, water would be a poor solvent, and almost all of the chemistry
that occurs in aqueous solutions would be impossible. This includes all of the biochemical reactions that occur in all of the life on earth. In a very real sense, your existence as
a living being depends on electric dipoles!
We examine two questions about electric dipoles. First, what forces and torques does
an electric dipole experience when placed in an external electric field (that is, a field set
up by charges outside the dipole)? Second, what electric field does an electric dipole itself
produce?

Force and Torque on an Electric Dipole
To start with the first question, let's place an electric dipole in a uniform external electric
field E, as shown in Fig. 31. Both forces F+ and F- on the two charges have magnitude qE, but their directions are opposite, and they add to zero. 
The net force on an electric dipole in a uniform external electric field is zero.
However, the two forces don't act along the same line, so their torques don't add to zero. 
We calculate torques with respect to the center of the dipole. 
Let the angle between the electric field E and the dipole axis be phi; then the lever arm for both F+ and F- is (d/2) sin phi. 
The torque of F+ and the torque of F- both have the same magnitude of
(qE)(1d/2) sin phi, and both torques tend to rotate the dipole clockwise (that is, tau is directed into the page in Fig. 31). 
Hence the magnitude of the net torque is twice the magnitude of either individual torque: tau = (qE)(d sin phi)

where d sin phi is the perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the two forces.
The product of the charge q and the separation d is the magnitude of a quantity called
the electric dipole moment, denoted by p: p = qd (magnitude of electric dipole moment)
The units of p are charge times distance C dot m. For example, the magnitude of the electric dipole moment of a water molecule is p = 6.13 * 10 to the -30 C dot m.

CAUTION The symbol p has multiple meanings Do not confuse dipole moment with momentum or pressure. 
There aren't as many letters in the alphabet as there are physical quantities, so some letters are used several times. 
The context usually makes it clear what we mean, but be careful. 
We further define the electric dipole moment to be a vector quantity p. 
The magnitude of p is given by Eq. 14, and its direction is along the dipole axis from the negative charge to the positive charge as shown in Fig. 31.
In terms of p, Eq. 13 for the magnitude t of the torque exerted by the field becomes tau = pE sin phi

Since the angle f in Fig. 31 is the angle between the directions of the vectors p and E,
this is reminiscent of the expression for the magnitude of the vector product discussed in
Section 1.10. (You may want to review that discussion.) Hence we can write the torque on the dipole in vector form as
tau = p X E

You can use the right-hand rule for the vector product to verify that in the situation shown in
Fig. 31, tau is directed into the page. The torque is greatest when p and E
 are perpendicular
and is zero when they are parallel or antiparallel. The torque always tends to turn p
 to line
it up with E. The position f = 0, with p parallel to E, is a position of stable equilibrium,
and the position f = p, with p and E antiparallel, is a position of unstable equilibrium. 
The polarization of a grass seed in the apparatus of Fig. 29b gives it an electric dipole moment;
the torque exerted by E then causes the seed to align with E and hence with the field lines.

Potential Energy of an Electric Dipole

When a dipole changes direction in an electric field, the electric-field torque does work on it, with a corresponding change in potential energy. 
The work dW done by a torque tau during an infinitesimal displacement df is given by Eq. (10.19): dW = tau d phi. Because the
torque is in the direction of decreasing f, we must write the torque as t = -p E sin phi, and dW = t df = -p E sin phi d phi
In a finite displacement from phi1 to phi2 the total work done on the dipole is

W = integral from phi 1 to phi 2 (-pE sin phi) dphi = pE Cos phi2 - pE cos phi1

The work is the negative of the change of potential energy, just as in Chapter 7:
W = U1 - U2. So a suitable definition of potential energy U for this system is
U1f2 = -pEcosf (17)
In this expression we recognize the scalar product p ~ E = pE cos phi, so we can also write

U = -p dot E

The potential energy has its minimum (most negative) value U = -pE at the stable equilibrium position, where f = 0 and p
 is parallel to E
. The potential energy is maximum
when f = p and p
 is antiparallel to E
; then U = +pE. At f = p>2, where p
 is perpendicular to E
, U is zero. We could define U differently so that it is zero at some other orientation of p
, but our definition is simplest.
Equation (18) gives us another way to look at the effect illustrated in Fig. 29. The
electric field E
 gives each grass seed an electric dipole moment, and the grass seed then
aligns itself with E
 to minimize the potential energy.

 KEYCONCEPT An electric dipole placed in an electric field tends to
orient itself with its dipole moment in the same direction as the field. 

In this discussion we have assumed that E
 is uniform, so there is no net force on the
dipole. If E
 is not uniform, the forces at the ends may not cancel completely, and the net
force may not be zero. Thus an object with zero net charge but an electric dipole moment
can experience a net force in a nonuniform electric field. As we mentioned in Section 1,
an uncharged object can be polarized by an electric field, giving rise to a separation of
charge and an electric dipole moment. This is how uncharged objects can experience
 electrostatic forces.

BIO APPLICATION A Fish with
an Electric Dipole Moment Unlike
the tiger shark (Section 4), which
senses the electric fields produced by its
prey, the African knifefish Gymnarchus
niloticus—which is nocturnal and has poor
vision—hunts other fish by generating its
own electric field. It can make its tail negatively charged relative to its head, producing
a dipole-like field similar to that in Fig.
28b. When a smaller fish ventures into
the field, its body alters the field pattern and
alerts G. niloticus that a meal is present.

Field of an Electric Dipole
Now let's think of an electric dipole as a source of electric field. Figure 28b shows the
general shape of the field due to a dipole. At each point in the pattern the total E field is the
vector sum of the fields from the two individual charges, as in Example 8 (Section 5).
Try drawing diagrams showing this vector sum for several points.
To get quantitative information about the field of an electric dipole, we have to do
some calculating, as illustrated in the next example. Notice the use of the principle of
superposition of electric fields to add up the contributions to the field of the individual
charges. Also notice that we need to use approximation techniques even for the relatively
simple case of a field due to two charges. Field calculations often become very complicated, and computer analysis is typically used to determine the field due to an arbitrary
charge distribution.

KEYCONCEPT The electric field produced by an electric dipole
is the vector sum of the fields produced by the positive and negative
charges that make up the dipole. At distances r from the dipole that
are large compared to the dipole size, the field magnitude is inversely
 proportional to the cube of r.

 TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF SECTION 7 An electric dipole is placed in a region of
uniform electric field E, with the electric dipole moment p pointing in the direction opposite to E.
Is the dipole 1 in stable equilibrium, 2 in unstable equilibrium, or 3 neither?

CHAPTER 21 SUMMARY
Electric charge, conductors, and insulators: The fundamental quantity in electrostatics is electric charge.
There are two kinds of charge, positive and negative. Charges of the same sign repel each other; charges of
opposite sign attract. Charge is conserved; the total charge in an isolated system is constant.
All ordinary matter is made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The positive protons and electrically neutral neutrons in the nucleus of an atom are bound together by the nuclear force; the negative electrons surround
the nucleus at distances much greater than the nuclear size. Electric interactions are chiefly responsible for the
structure of atoms, molecules, and solids.
Conductors are materials in which charge moves easily; in insulators, charge does not move easily. Most
metals are good conductors; most nonmetals are insulators.

Coulomb's law: For charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance
r, the magnitude of the electric force on either charge is proportional to the product q1q2 and inversely proportional to
r2. The force on each charge is along the line joining the two
charges—repulsive if q1 and q2 have the same sign, attractive if
they have opposite signs. In SI units the unit of electric charge
is the coulomb, abbreviated C.
When two or more charges each exert a force on a charge,
the total force on that charge is the vector sum of the forces exerted by the individual charges. (See Examples 3 and 4.)

Electric field: Electric field E, a vector quantity, is the force
per unit charge exerted on a test charge at any point. The electric field produced by a point charge is directed radially away
from a positive charge and radially toward a negative charge.

Superposition of electric fields: The electric field E
 of any combination of charges is the vector sum of the
fields caused by the individual charges. To calculate the electric field caused by a continuous distribution of
charge, divide the distribution into small elements, calculate the field caused by each element, and then carry
out the vector sum, usually by integrating. Charge distributions are described by linear charge density l, surface charge density s, and volume charge density r. (See Examples 8-12.)

Electric field lines: Field lines provide a graphical representation of electric fields. At any point on a field line,
the tangent to the line is in the direction of E
 at that point. The number of lines per unit area (perpendicular to
their direction) is proportional to the magnitude of E at the point.

 Electric dipoles: An electric dipole is a pair of electric charges
of equal magnitude q but opposite sign, separated by a distance d. The electric dipole moment p has magnitude p = qd.
The direction of p is from negative toward positive charge.
An electric dipole in an electric field E experiences a torque tau equal to the vector product of p and E. The magnitude of the
torque depends on the angle f between p and E. The potential
energy U for an electric dipole in an electric field also depends
on the relative orientation of p and E.
